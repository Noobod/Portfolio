# XFlyve Transport Management System — Automating 70% of Logistics Workflow

Logistics relies heavily on coordination — drivers, trucks, proof of delivery, and compliance reporting.  
Yet many transportation companies still manage all of this using **phone calls**, **WhatsApp photos**, **spreadsheets**, and **manual logs**.

When I worked with a logistics team, I saw the same pattern:

> **Too much time wasted on admin instead of operations.**

So I created **XFlyve Logistics Automation Platform** — a system to automate workflows, digitize work diaries, and streamline delivery tracking.

## 🚧 The Problem

Before XFlyve, the workflow looked like this:

- Jobs assigned manually through calls or messages  
- Drivers typed work diaries separately  
- POD images shared via WhatsApp or Messenger  
- Spreadsheets updated nightly  
- No central tracking  
- No real-time dashboard  

This caused:

❌ Delays  
❌ Confusion  
❌ Lost documents  
❌ Admin overload  
❌ No operation visibility  

---

## 🎯 The Goal

Replace unorganized communication and paperwork with **one automated system**.

✔ Automate repetitive tasks  
✔ Improve real-time tracking  
✔ Create clean driver ↔ admin workflow  

📌 **Target outcome: ≥ 70% automation of manual work**

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Frontend | React (Vite), Material UI, Axios |
| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose |
| Auth | JWT + Role-based permissions |
| File Upload | Cloudinary (POD + evidence photos) |

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

Driver App → REST API → MongoDB
↘ Cloudinary (storage)
Admin Panel ← REST API ← Database


Everything was structured modularly so future features (GPS tracking, payroll automation, invoicing) can be added.

---

## 🔥 Core Features

### 👨‍💼 Admin Panel

- Assign jobs to drivers  
- Review submitted PODs  
- Track job completion status  
- Manage users (RBAC)  
- Export reports  

### 🚚 Driver Interface

- View assigned jobs in real-time  
- Submit proof of delivery  
- Submit work diary in guided steps  
- Offline support (coming soon)
