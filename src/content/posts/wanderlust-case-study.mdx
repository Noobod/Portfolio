Wanderlust is a full-stack accommodation booking platform inspired by Airbnb.
I built it to practice system design, authentication, and end-to-end CRUD workflows.

Problem

Most tutorials cover isolated concepts, but I wanted a project that connects everything—users, bookings, authentication, listings, images, and search.

What I Built

Wanderlust includes:

User authentication and session handling

Listing creation with images

Map-based search

Booking form and reservation flow

Admin-style dashboard for managing listings

Tech & Architecture

Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

EJS templates for server-side rendering

Cloudinary for image uploads

Structured in MVC architecture

Challenges

Designing a clean database schema for bookings and listings

Handling multiple image uploads

Ensuring server-side validation

Keeping the UI simple and responsive

What I Learned

This project solidified my understanding of full-stack logic, data modeling, authentication, and how real booking workflows operate.
