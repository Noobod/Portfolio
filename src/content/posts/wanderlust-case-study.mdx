## Wanderlust — Full-Stack Accommodation Booking Platform

Wanderlust is a full-stack accommodation booking platform inspired by Airbnb. I built this project to practice end-to-end system design, authentication, and real-world CRUD workflows in a single cohesive application.

Instead of focusing on isolated features, my goal was to build a complete booking flow that connects users, listings, images, and reservations.

---

## Problem I Observed

Most tutorials focus on individual concepts such as authentication, CRUD operations, or image uploads in isolation. I wanted a project that combined all these pieces into a realistic, production-style workflow.

---

## What I Built

Wanderlust includes the following core functionality:

- User authentication and session handling  
- Listing creation and management with image uploads  
- Map-based listing search  
- Booking and reservation flow  
- Admin-style interface for managing listings  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose  
- **Templating:** EJS (server-side rendering)  
- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary  

---

## Architecture & Design

The application is structured using an **MVC architecture**, separating routing, business logic, and data models for better maintainability.

MongoDB schemas were designed to handle relationships between users, listings, and bookings, ensuring data consistency throughout the booking process.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Database schema design** → carefully modeled relationships between listings and bookings  
- **Multiple image uploads** → integrated Cloudinary for reliable image storage  
- **Server-side validation** → ensured data integrity and secure form handling  
- **UI simplicity** → kept the interface clean and responsive across devices  

---

## Results

- End-to-end booking workflow implemented successfully  
- Improved understanding of full-stack application flow  
- Practical experience with authentication and data modeling  
- A realistic project simulating real-world booking systems  

---

## What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

- Full-stack application development  
- Database modeling and relationships  
- Authentication and session management  
- Designing complete user workflows  
- Building maintainable MVC-based applications
