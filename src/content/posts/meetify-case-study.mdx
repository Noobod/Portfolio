## Meetify — Real-Time Video Meeting Platform

Meetify is a real-time video meeting application built to understand peer-to-peer communication, real-time signaling, and multi-user application flows. The project focuses on building a functional video conferencing experience using modern web technologies.

The goal was not to create a production-grade meeting tool, but to deeply understand how real-time systems work end to end.

---

## Problem I Wanted to Solve

Most applications rely on request-response flows, but real-time communication introduces different challenges such as live media streaming, connection signaling, and user coordination.

I wanted to build a project that would help me understand:

- How peer-to-peer video and audio streaming works  
- How users join and leave real-time sessions  
- How signaling servers coordinate connections  
- How real-time features fit into a full-stack application  

---

## What I Built

Meetify includes the following core functionality:

- User authentication (register and login)  
- Ability to create or join video meeting rooms  
- Real-time audio and video streaming using WebRTC  
- Socket.IO-based signaling for peer connection setup  
- Responsive UI across desktop and mobile devices  
- Meeting history stored in the database  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), CSS Modules  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Real-Time:** WebRTC, Socket.IO  

---

## Architecture & Design

Meetify follows a client-server architecture where:

- WebRTC handles peer-to-peer audio and video streaming  
- Socket.IO manages signaling and room coordination  
- The backend stores user and meeting metadata  
- The frontend manages UI state and media streams  

This separation keeps real-time communication logic isolated from standard API workflows.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Managing peer connections** → used Socket.IO rooms for signaling coordination  
- **Handling multiple users** → managed connection lifecycle events carefully  
- **Media permissions and device access** → implemented proper browser handling  
- **Responsive layout** → optimized UI for different screen sizes  

---

## Results

- Successfully implemented multi-user video meetings  
- Gained hands-on experience with WebRTC and real-time signaling  
- Improved understanding of real-time application architecture  
- Built confidence working with complex async flows  

---

## What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

- Real-time communication concepts  
- WebRTC peer-to-peer media streaming  
- Socket-based signaling and coordination  
- Full-stack application design involving real-time features  
- Debugging asynchronous and event-driven systems
