I worked on improving a local councillor’s public website, focusing on community request management.

Problem

Previously, people submitted requests through basic forms that went straight to email, which made it hard to track issues or manage follow-ups.

What I Built

I created a custom WordPress plugin that adds:

A community request submission form

Support for anonymous or identified submissions

Internal admin dashboard for managing requests

Status updates and filtering options

Server-side validation and security checks

Custom database tables to store submissions cleanly

Tech Used

PHP, WordPress Plugin APIs

MySQL integration

Challenges

Designing the plugin to match WordPress coding standards

Managing form data outside default WP post types

Creating an easy-to-use admin panel for non-technical users

What I Learned

This project helped me understand plugin architecture, backend logic in PHP, and how to build custom admin tools inside WordPress.
