I wanted my portfolio to feel more interactive than a typical static website, so I added a small chat-style interface that introduces my projects and experience.

What I Built

The chatbot is a floating component built with React + Framer Motion that:

Opens as a slide-up chat panel

Shows predefined prompts

Lets visitors explore my skills and projects

Includes input UI (AI replies coming later)

Even though it is not connected to a backend model yet, the structure is ready for API integration.

Tech Used

Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion

Component-based structure

Controlled state for panel visibility

Challenges

Smooth animations without jitter

Keeping it responsive on mobile

Designing it to be non-intrusive but noticeable

What I Learned

I improved my understanding of UI animation, component state, and designing features that enhance user experience without adding complexity.
