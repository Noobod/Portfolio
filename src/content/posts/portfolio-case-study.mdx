## Making My Portfolio More Interactive

I wanted my portfolio to feel more engaging than a typical static website, so I designed and built a small chat-style interface that helps visitors explore my projects and experience in an interactive way.

Instead of forcing users to scroll through sections, the chat component guides them through my skills and work in a conversational format.

---

## What I Built

I developed a floating chat-style UI component with the following behavior:

- Opens as a slide-up chat panel  
- Displays predefined prompts for visitors  
- Allows users to explore my skills, projects, and experience  
- Includes an input UI for future AI-powered responses  

Although the chatbot is not yet connected to a backend AI model, the structure is designed to support easy API integration later.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js  
- **Language:** TypeScript  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **Animation:** Framer Motion  

---

## Architecture & Design

The component follows a clean, component-based structure using controlled React state to manage visibility and interaction flow.

Animations were handled with Framer Motion to ensure smooth transitions while keeping the UI lightweight and responsive.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Smooth animations without jitter** → fine-tuned Framer Motion transitions  
- **Mobile responsiveness** → tested and adjusted layout for smaller screens  
- **Non-intrusive UX** → designed the component to stay subtle while remaining discoverable

## Results

- Portfolio feels more interactive and engaging  
- Visitors can explore content without navigating multiple sections  
- UI enhances user experience without adding complexity  

---

## What I Learned

This project helped me improve my skills in:

- Building interactive UI components with React  
- Managing component state effectively  
- Creating smooth, user-friendly animations  
- Designing features that enhance UX without overwhelming users
