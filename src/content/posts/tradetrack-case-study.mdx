## TradeTrack — Trading Dashboard Simulation Platform

TradeTrack is a simulated trading dashboard inspired by modern stock trading platforms. I built this project to practice frontend-heavy application design, authentication flows, data visualisation, and end-to-end MERN architecture.

The focus of this project was not real trading, but building a realistic dashboard experience using simulated data.

---

## Problem I Wanted to Solve

Many trading platforms have complex interfaces that combine large amounts of data, charts, and user actions in one place. I wanted to build a project that mimics this complexity to better understand:

- Dashboard-style UI design  
- Managing multiple data views (holdings, positions, orders)  
- Authentication and session handling  
- Chart-based data visualisation  

---

## What I Built

TradeTrack includes the following functionality:

- Secure user authentication (simulated accounts)  
- Dashboard views for holdings, positions, and orders  
- Simulated order placement and historical data  
- Interactive charts for visualising trading data  
- Fully responsive UI for desktop and mobile devices  

All data is simulated and stored in the database for learning purposes.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Bootstrap, Material UI  
- **Charts:** Chart.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas)  
- **Authentication:** Passport.js (local strategy)  

---

## Architecture & Design

The project is structured as a multi-part MERN application:

- React-based landing page  
- React dashboard application for authenticated users  
- Express backend with MongoDB models  

This separation helped keep the dashboard logic, API layer, and data models organised and maintainable.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Complex UI layout** → broke dashboard into reusable components  
- **Handling multiple datasets** → structured backend responses clearly  
- **Authentication flow** → implemented session-based login using Passport.js  
- **Responsive design** → tested layouts across screen sizes  

---

## Results

- Built a realistic trading dashboard experience using simulated data  
- Gained confidence working with dashboard-heavy UIs  
- Improved understanding of authentication and data visualisation  
- Strengthened MERN full-stack development skills  

---

## What I Learned

This project helped me improve my skills in:

- Designing complex dashboard interfaces  
- Managing application state across multiple views  
- Working with chart libraries for data visualisation  
- Structuring larger MERN applications
