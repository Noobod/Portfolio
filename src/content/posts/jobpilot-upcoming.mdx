## JobPilot — Automating the Job Search Process (Coming Soon)

JobPilot is an upcoming project I’m currently planning and designing. The idea came from my own job hunting experience, where switching between job portals, tracking applications, and managing follow-ups became repetitive and time-consuming.

### Goal of the Project
Create a tool that helps job seekers:

- Track applications across multiple platforms  
- Get reminders for follow-ups  
- Save job descriptions systematically  
- Analyse skills required across roles  

### Planned Features
- Application tracking dashboard  
- Job description parsing  
- AI-powered role recommendations  
- Status reminders for follow-ups  
- Resume skill-gap insights  

### Tech Stack (Planned)
Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Tailwind, OpenAI API

### Why Build This?
Job searching is often a disorganized experience. JobPilot aims to simplify the process by providing one clean, automated system.

More updates coming soon as development begins.
