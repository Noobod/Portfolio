## JobPilot — Automating the Job Search Process (Planned)

JobPilot is an upcoming project that I am currently planning and designing based on my own job search experience. While applying for roles, I noticed that managing applications across multiple platforms, tracking follow-ups, and analysing role requirements quickly becomes repetitive and disorganised.

The goal of JobPilot is to bring the entire job search process into one structured system.

---

## Problem I Observed

During my job search:

- Applications were spread across multiple job portals  
- Follow-up dates were easy to forget  
- Job descriptions were difficult to track and compare  
- Identifying common skill requirements took manual effort  

This made the job search process inefficient and hard to manage over time.

## Project Goal

JobPilot aims to help job seekers:

- Track job applications across multiple platforms  
- Receive reminders for follow-ups  
- Save and organise job descriptions  
- Analyse skill requirements across applied roles  

---

## Planned Features

The initial planned features include:

- Centralised application tracking  
- Job description parsing and storage  
- Status reminders for follow-ups  
- Skill-gap insights based on applied roles  
- AI-powered role and skill recommendations

## Planned Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API  

---

## Design & Planning Approach

The project is being designed with modular components so features can be built incrementally. The focus is on starting with core tracking functionality before introducing AI-powered insights.

This approach allows the platform to evolve based on real usage and feedback.

---

## Why Build This?

Job searching is often a fragmented experience. JobPilot is intended to simplify the process by providing one clean, automated system that reduces manual effort and improves organisation.

## Status

JobPilot is currently in the **planning and design phase**.  
Development updates will be shared as implementation begins.
