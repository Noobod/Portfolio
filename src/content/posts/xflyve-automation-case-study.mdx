## XFlyve Logistics Automation — Reducing Manual Work by ~70%

While working closely with a small logistics team, I noticed that most daily operations relied heavily on WhatsApp messages, spreadsheets, and phone calls. Job assignments, proof of delivery (POD), and work diaries were handled manually, leading to delays, data loss, and unnecessary administrative effort.

To solve this, I designed and built **XFlyve**, an internal web-based automation system that replaced these fragmented workflows with a single platform.

---

## Problem I Observed

Before XFlyve:

- Jobs were shared via calls or WhatsApp messages  
- POD images were sent informally and often lost  
- Work diaries were written manually  
- Admins updated spreadsheets at the end of the day  
- No central system to track job status  

This resulted in errors, duplicate work, and constant back-and-forth communication.

---

## What I Built

I created an internal system with two main user roles:

### Admin Interface
- Create and assign jobs to drivers  
- Review uploaded PODs and delivery notes  
- Track job status in one place  
- Manage users and role access  

### Driver Interface
- Secure login to view assigned jobs  
- Upload POD images and delivery notes  
- Submit work diaries digitally  
- Mark jobs as completed

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Material UI  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express  
**Database:** MongoDB  
**Auth:** JWT-based authentication  
**File Storage:** Cloudinary  
**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)

---

## Architecture & Design

The backend follows a clean **MVC structure**, allowing new features to be added without major refactoring.  
All job-related data is stored in MongoDB, and file uploads are handled via Cloudinary.

The system was intentionally designed to be extensible for future enhancements such as notifications or payroll automation.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Inconsistent driver submissions** → added form validation  
- **Large image uploads** → enabled automatic compression  
- **Admin visibility issues** → structured job status flows  
- **Mobile usability** → simplified screens and step-based flow  

---

## Results

After adopting XFlyve:

- Manual admin workload reduced by approximately **70%**
- Drivers submitted PODs and diaries faster
- Job tracking became simpler and more reliable
- Operational communication became more structured
- All records were stored centrally instead of scattered chats

## What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

- Designing systems around real operational problems  
- Structuring APIs and backend logic cleanly  
- Authentication and role-based access control  
- UX decisions for non-technical users  
- Deploying and maintaining full-stack applications
