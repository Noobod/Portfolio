XFlyve Transport Management System — Reducing Manual Work by 70%

When I worked closely with a small logistics team, I noticed that most of their daily operations still relied on WhatsApp messages, spreadsheets, and phone calls. Job assignments, proof of delivery, work diaries — everything was handled manually, which caused delays and unnecessary admin workload.

To fix this, I designed and developed XFlyve, a simple but scalable automation system that replaces most of those manual steps with a single web platform.

Problem I Observed

Before building XFlyve:

Jobs were shared over calls or messages

Drivers submitted POD photos through WhatsApp

Work diaries were written manually

Admins updated spreadsheets at the end of the day

There was no central dashboard

This led to mistakes, lost files, and a lot of back-and-forth communication.

What I Built

I created a system with two key interfaces:

Admin

Assign jobs to drivers

Review submitted PODs

Track job status in one dashboard

Manage users and roles

View job history and reports

Driver

View assigned jobs

Upload POD and delivery notes

Submit work diary digitally

Mark jobs as completed

Tech Stack

React, Material UI, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Cloudinary, JWT Auth, Render, Vercel

Architecture

I structured the backend in a clean MVC pattern so new features (GPS, notifications, payroll automation) can be added without rewriting the system.

File uploads go through Cloudinary, and all job-related activity is stored in MongoDB.

Biggest Challenges

Drivers submitting inconsistent data → added validation

Large images slowing uploads → automatic compression

Admins needing status visibility → built activity logs

Confusing mobile UX → simplified screens and step-based flow

Results

After the system was used:

Admin manual workload dropped by around 70%

Drivers submitted PODs and diaries faster

Job status became easier to track

Communication gaps were reduced

Everything was stored in one place instead of multiple chats

What I Learned

This project helped me improve in:

Designing systems around real problems

Structuring APIs properly

Authentication and role management

Thinking about UX for non-technical users

Deploying full-stack apps with CI/CD
